# Weather App üå¶Ô∏è
**The Goal**<br/>
The goal of this project was to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. I focused on performing time-consuming tasks such as fetching device location and networking to get data from the internet.

## What I Built
I created a weather app that shows live weather data based on the device's current location, as well as for any city the user chooses.

## The Finished App
The app is a minimalist weather app, with a focus on functionality rather than UI design.

## What I Learned
**I learned the following:**<br/>

‚Ä¢ How to use Dart to perform asynchronous tasks.<br/>
‚Ä¢ Understanding async and await.<br/>
‚Ä¢ Working with Futures.<br/>
‚Ä¢ How to make network requests with the Dart DIO package.<br/>
‚Ä¢ What APIs are and how to use them to fetch data from the internet.<br/>
‚Ä¢ Understanding JSON and parsing it using the Dart convert package.<br/>
‚Ä¢ Passing data between screens using the Navigator.<br/>
‚Ä¢ Handling exceptions in Dart using try/catch/throw.<br/>
‚Ä¢ The lifecycle of Stateful Widgets and how to override them.<br/>
‚Ä¢ How to use the Geolocator package to fetch live location data for both iOS and Android.  **Future Work**<br/>
‚Ä¢ Using the TextField widget to take user input.<br/>
‚Ä¢ I learned BLoC state management for managing the app's state efficiently.<br/>
‚Ä¢ I also learned how to work with ThemeData to create dynamic themes based on the weather conditions, allowing the app's appearance to change depending on the weather.<br/>
