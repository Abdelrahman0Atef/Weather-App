Weather App üå¶Ô∏è
The Goal
The goal of this project was to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. I focused on performing time-consuming tasks such as fetching device location and networking to get data from the internet.

What I Built
I created a weather app that shows live weather data based on the device's current location, as well as for any city the user chooses.

The Finished App
The app is a minimalist weather app, with a focus on functionality rather than UI design.

What I Learned
I learned the following:

How to use Dart to perform asynchronous tasks.
Understanding async and await.
Working with Futures.
How to make network requests with the Dart DIO package.
What APIs are and how to use them to fetch data from the internet.
Understanding JSON and parsing it using the Dart convert package.
Passing data between screens using the Navigator.
Handling exceptions in Dart using try/catch/throw.
The lifecycle of Stateful Widgets and how to override them.
How to use the Geolocator package to fetch live location data for both iOS and Android.  Future Work
Using the TextField widget to take user input.
I learned BLoC state management for managing the app's state efficiently.
I also learned how to work with ThemeData to create dynamic themes based on the weather conditions, allowing the app's appearance to change depending on the weather.
